				<p>Any transaction (i) in which the corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary was a party, (ii) in which an “interested person” had a direct or indirect material financial interest, and (iii) which involved more than $50,000, or was one of a number of transactions with the same interested person involving, in the aggregate, more than $50,000. For this purpose, an “interested person” is either of the following:</p>
				<p>Any director or officer of the corporation, its parent, or subsidiary (but mere common directorship shall not be considered such an interest); or
				Any holder of more than 10 percent of the voting power of the corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary. The statement shall include a brief description of the transaction, the names of interested persons involved, their relationship to the corporation, the nature of their interest in the transaction and, if practicable, the amount of that interest, provided that if the transaction was with a partnership in which the interested person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.</p>
				<p>A brief description of the amounts and circumstances of any loans, guaranties, indemnifications, or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the corporation under Article 8 of these bylaws, unless the loan, guaranty, indemnification, or advance is not subject to the provisions of subdivision (a) of Section 7235(a) of that Code.</p>
